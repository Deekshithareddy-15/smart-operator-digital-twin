# 🏗️ Smart Operator Assistant

### Digital Twin-Powered Intelligence for Construction Equipment

A Digital Twin-based system that converts construction-machine telemetry into machine health insights, anomaly detection, intelligent alerts, and actionable recommendations for operators.

---

## 📌 Overview

Modern construction machines generate large amounts of telemetry such as engine temperature, RPM, hydraulic pressure, fuel consumption, machine load, and safety information.

The **Smart Operator Assistant** creates a software-based **Digital Twin** of the machine that continuously represents its operational state.

Instead of only displaying raw sensor values, the system analyzes machine conditions and provides meaningful information such as:

- Machine health
- Abnormal operating conditions
- Parameter trends
- Safety conditions
- Intelligent decisions
- Actionable recommendations

The Digital Twin serves as the foundation for a future intelligent operator assistant.

## 💡 Problem & Solution

### Problem

Modern construction equipment is becoming increasingly complex, while operators still need to understand machine behavior quickly and safely.

Raw telemetry can tell an operator:

```text
Engine Temperature: 126°C
Hydraulic Pressure: 368 bar
Load: 87%
But it does not directly explain:

What is happening?
How serious is it?
Why is it happening?
What should the operator do?
Solution

The system transforms raw telemetry into contextual machine intelligence:

Raw Telemetry
      ↓
Machine State
      ↓
Trend & State Analysis
      ↓
Condition Detection
      ↓
Decision
      ↓
Recommendation
      ↓
Operator Action


**✨ Current Features**

🦺 Safety condition monitoring
🧠 Decision engine
💡 Recommendation engine
📸 Digital Twin snapshots
🧪 End-to-end pipeline testing


**📊 Dataset**

The prototype uses 10,000 synthetic telemetry records representing different machine operating conditions.

Simulated Scenarios
NORMAL
HEAVY_LOAD
EXCESSIVE_IDLE
HYDRAULIC_ANOMALY
OVERHEATING
FUEL_INEFFICIENCY
SENSOR_ANOMALY
SAFETY_VIOLATION
Key Parameters
Engine temperature
Engine RPM
Hydraulic pressure
Fuel level
Fuel consumption
Machine load
Machine speed
Idle time
Operator presence
Seatbelt status
Machine health

The dataset is generated using:

simulator/generate_dataset.py
🧠 Example

The system converts raw telemetry such as:

Engine Temperature: 126°C
Load: 87%

into an actionable decision:

CRITICAL: Engine Overheating

Recommendation:
Stop heavy operation and allow the engine to cool.
Inspect the cooling system before continuing.

This allows the system to move from monitoring data to supporting operator decisions.
